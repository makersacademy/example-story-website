  - title: Why change careers?
    content: The more I learned about design, the more I wanted to engage in critical issues with design. I realised that the best way to do this was through combining design with software technology.
  - title: Journey
    content: I started self-learning in my spare time. I started learning Python, and doing online courses. I quickly became obsessed with coding and even found myself dreaming in code. After 6 months I decided to make the big change….
  - title: Applying for a bootcamp
    content: I started researching bootcamps. I decided on Makers, because I resonated with their pedagogical approach of self-learning and colloboration. In order to be accepted I needed to learn Ruby. I found there was a lot of cross-over between Python so it was quite easy to learn. I was very excited when I learnt I was accepted. It was actually going to happen… I was going to become a software developer!
